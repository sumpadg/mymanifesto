        <h2>1. take photos.</h2>

            </div>
<p>Look at it from far away. No one is analyzing your project like you are. Imagine seeing it for the first time; what would you think?</p>
 <div class="wideleftmargin blue">
        <div id="footer">
        <h2>3. leave it for tomorrow.</h2>
        </div>
<p>Your designs are not ugly, they are just ingrained in your head; boring. Wait and look at it with tomorrow's eyes. Rework, but know when to leave it be.</p>

<div id="footer">
        <h2>4. change it to black + white.</h2>
            </div>
<p>All the colors you use when designing are overwhelming. Keep it in B&W and save the color palette for the end, that’s the fun part anyway.</p>
 <div class="wideleftmargin blue">
        <div id="footer">
        <h2>5. simple + expressive = <3. </h2>
        </div>
<p>Simple doesn’t have to be too cold. Expressiveness doesn’t have to be too hot. Mix them and it’ll be just right.</p>

        <h2>6. draw.</h2>
            </div>
<p>Plan by drawing. Pinterest kills your thoughts and floods them with pre existing ideas.</p>

        <div id="footer">
        <h2>7. intersect, connect, interact.</h2>
        </div>
<p>Find where edges can be joined. Intersect them so they can connect with one another. Have them interact with each other, designs don’t like to be lonely.</p>

<div class="blue">
<div id="footer">
        <h2>8. illustrate with type.</h2>
            </div>
<p>It’s like reading a drawing.</p>

        <div id="footer">
        <h2>9. sleep with your sketchbook.</h2>
        </div>
<p>Some of the best ideas come to you right before you go to sleep. You snooze, you lose. Write them down and draw them out.</p>

        <h2>10. contrast sharp with curve.</h2>
            </div>
    <p>What’s a sharp form’s best friend? A curved form. Opposites attract.</p>
 <div class="wideleftmargin blue">
        <div id="footer">
        <h2>11. decide what's dominate.</h2>
        </div>
<p>Maybe it should be really small. Maybe people have to search for the answers. Or maybe, it’s so big and in front of their face that they miss it completely Keep them on their toes.</p>
